# CSC-579-P2P-Video-streaming-simulation
Project outline
This project aims at showing the construction, application, and inspection of a prototype of P2P video streaming application, focusing on the essential dynamics of the real world, like peer distance, network conditions, and peer volatility.
The system utilizes dash.js and P2PEngineDash, both of which allow multiple peers to stream a single video concurrently and contain user and network simulation capabilities. The selected ABR logic is based on the estimation of throughput, and is incorporated into the system design in order to optimize the performance.

How to run the prototype
1. clone the code
2. node server.js
3. In a different tab: node simulation.js
4. For view of realtime figures, go to webpage : "host/visual"
